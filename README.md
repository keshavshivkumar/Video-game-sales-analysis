# Video-game-sales-analysis
The main motive of this project is to visualize the physical sales of video games around the world, and to identify which genres appear prevalent to society. 
The project follows up with the establishment of the superior platforms, and publishers of video games. Based on the numerous factors like the critic score, platform, 
genre, publisher, etc. considered in this scheme, we predict the probabilities of certain video games that can become hits (sales over 1M units).
